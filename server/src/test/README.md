# Test strategy... 👨‍🔬

## Unit tests

- Will test a separate unit of the code, mostly helper functions and perhaps later on also Prisma mocked models.

## Integration tests

- Will test an integration of separate units. Most of the times this will be a routing part, controlling part and a model part.
