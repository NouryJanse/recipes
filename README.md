Thank you for taking the time to read. The platform's repository consists of four applications:

- admin-app
- admin-server
- client-app
- client-server

The app generates groceries shopping lists from recipes. Recipes that you can create yourself or pick from the database of inspiring recipes by others. Note that this app is a work in progress and that its purpose is mostly to demonstrate my experience, current skillset at last but not least: interests as an engineer üßë‚Äçüíª. Please refer to some screenshots at the bottom.

üéà **it's not possible to run this platform locally without a Cloudinary, a PostgreSQL db and a MongoDB db (which need be set in various .env files). Please contact me for a demo. üéà**
